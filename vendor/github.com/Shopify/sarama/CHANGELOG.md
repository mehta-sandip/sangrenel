#### Version 1.0.0 (2015-04-17)

Version 1.0.0 is the first tagged version, and is almost a complete rewrite. The primary differences with previous untagged versions are:

- The producer has been rewritten; there is now a `SyncProducer` with a blocking API, and an `AsyncProducer` that is non-blocking.
- The consumer has been rewritten to only open one connection per broker instead of one connection per partition.
- The main types of Sarama are now interfaces to make depedency injection easy; mock implementations for `Consumer`, `SyncProducer` and `AsyncProducer` are provided in the `github.com/mehta-sandip/sangrenel/vendor/github.com/Shopify/sarama/mocks` package.
- For most uses cases, it is not no longer necessary to open a `Client`; this will be done for you.
- All the configuration values have been unified in the `Config` struct.
- Much improved test suite.
